This is the simplest representation of a 3-tier, the best ways for prod environment are not EC2 any more as we have more scalable, reliable and resiliant solutions like EKS, ECS, serverless(lambda, CDN, API gateway,SQS or MSK and dynamodb) etc.
I have gone with EC2 because of time constraint, cost and simplicity for the demo app which will never run on prod.
given time and resources, i prefer EKS or serverless depending on the nature of the microservices that we would run.

prequesites:
aws configure and setup default profile
run terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply
after review run terraform destroy.


todo:
add asgs
add rds
add demo app
add count to make subnet, ec2 for better scalability of code.
parameterize
add tfvar and if needed creds for db and git encrypt the tfvars
